# Simplified Columnar Temporal Learning (SCTL)
SCTL is a simplified columnar temporal learning inspired by Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a framework that replicates the functioning of the Neocortex.

# HTM vs SCTL
SCTL is focused on results rather than bilogical constraints, while still retaining the same representation of the data as HTM.

# Motivation
Many circuits in the brain rely on HTM representations as a basis for learning. However, the HTM library is not well suited for machine learning in practice.
