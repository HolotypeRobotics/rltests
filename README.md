# RL Tests
This is a collection of model implementations for experimenting with ACC/PFC/Hippocampus behaviors. All implementations are in pytorch or numpy.

## RML
Reinforcement meta learning. Similar structure to the PRO model, but focuses on "boosting".

## PRO
Is really the "PRO-Control" model. Stands for Prediction Response Outcome, and is considered one of the most accurate model for the ACC.

## Hippocampus
Some modelling of signals from different parts of the hippocampus, with the intention of using them to feed navigational data to the PFC.
